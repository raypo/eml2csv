# eml2csv Privacy Policy

Eml2csv takes your privacy very seriously. All mail data you import will only be used locally on the device, and no data will be uploaded (eml2csv is a full local stand-alone application, no remote server). And no user behavior or application usage statistics are generated or uploaded.

### What personal information we collect or access

- eml2csv is completely a local stand-alone application, so it does not collect any of your personal information and does not access any other information of your device.


We may update our privacy policy at any time. If there are major changes to our privacy policy, we will update our privacy policy on this page(https://github.com/raypo/eml2csv/blob/master/privacy/privacy-en.md).
